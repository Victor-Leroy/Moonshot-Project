# Moonshot Project- Doodle Accessibility Enhancements

## Overview
Doodle is a widely used scheduling tool, but its current interface presents challenges for blind and visually impaired users who rely on screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver. This project aims to improve accessibility by enhancing navigation, labeling, and feedback without modifying Doodle’s core functionality.

## Features
- **Improved keyboard navigation** – Ensuring a logical tab order and focus management.
- **ARIA enhancements** – Adding proper labels and live region updates for screen readers.
- **Real-time feedback** – Immediate confirmation when selecting time slots.
- **Mobile accessibility improvements** – Optimizing for VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android).
- **(Future) Voice command support** – Allowing users to select and submit choices using speech input.

## Installation & Usage
Since we cannot modify Doodle’s source code, this project will use **browser-side scripts** and **extensions** to improve accessibility dynamically. Instructions for installing the enhancements will be provided soon.

## Roadmap
- ✅ Identify accessibility issues.
- ✅ Define solutions (ARIA fixes, keyboard navigation improvements, screen reader optimization).
- 🔧 Develop a browser script for dynamic enhancements.
- 🔍 Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.
- 🚀 Optimize mobile experience.
- 🎙️ Explore voice-based interaction (future goal).

## Contributing
Feedback from screen reader users and accessibility experts is highly encouraged. If you have suggestions or would like to test the improvements, feel free to contribute!
