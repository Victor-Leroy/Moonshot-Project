# Roadmap - Doodle Accessibility Enhancements

### Objective

The primary goal is to develop a working prototype that demonstrates improved accessibility for screen reader users on Doodle. The project will focus on essential navigation fixes, ARIA enhancements, and real-time feedback for selections. Future phases may explore voice command functionality, but the core requirement is a functional and testable prototype for the final presentation.

### 🔹 Objective: Understand the specific needs of screen reader users and define the functionalities to develop.
#### ✅ Tasks:

- [x] Study web accessibility principles (WCAG, ARIA, NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).

- [x] Identify the main accessibility barriers on Doodle for screen reader users.

- [x] Define priority improvements.

- [ ] Draft a functional and technical specifications document.
#### 📍 Deliverable: A detailed specifications document.

## Phase 2: Prototype and Preliminary Development (March 11 - April 7)

### 🔹 Objective: Develop a working prototype that demonstrates accessibility improvements.
#### ✅ Tasks:

- [x] Implement ARIA improvements and keyboard navigation enhancements.

- [x] Develop an interactive prototype for time slot selection.

- [x] Test audio confirmations and user feedback mechanisms.
#### 📍 Deliverable: A functional prototype showcasing navigation improvements.

## Phase 3: Refinement & Internal Testing (April 8 - May 5)

### 🔹 Objective: Ensure the prototype is stable, functional, and ready for real-world testing.
#### ✅ Tasks:

- [x] Finalize the screen reader-optimized interface.

- [x] Improve real-time feedback for selections.

- [x] Test the prototype with NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.

## Phase 4: User Testing & Iterations (May 6 - June 2)

### 🔹 Objective: Validate accessibility improvements with blind and visually impaired users.
#### ✅ Tasks:

- [x] Conduct usability testing with screen reader users.

- [x] Gather user feedback and identify necessary improvements.

- [x] Apply refinements to optimize the experience.
#### 📍 Deliverable: A refined prototype, incorporating user feedback.

## Phase 5: Finalization and Presentation Preparation (June 3 - June 17)

### 🔹 Objective: Prepare for the final demonstration and project presentation.
#### ✅ Tasks:

- [x] Conduct final stability tests and bug fixes.

- [ ] Prepare a structured demonstration script.

- [ ] Develop presentation materials showcasing accessibility improvements.
#### 📍 Deliverable: A fully working prototype, ready for the final presentation.

## Phase 6: Final Presentation & Closure (June 18 - June 24)

### 🔹 Objective: Present and defend the project to stakeholders.
#### ✅ Tasks:

- [ ] Prepare a clear and accessible presentation.

- [ ] Conduct a live or recorded demonstration.

- [ ] Answer final questions from evaluators.
#### 📍 Deliverable: A successful project presentation with a demonstrable prototype.
